Getting rid of copied JSON library (org.json.*, org.json.zip.*)
	finds out proper Maven repository

Exception-safety SequenceFileWriter
	uses temporal file swapping for avoiding output inconsistency at failures
	unifies similar code written in each NLPJob class (e.g., fs.rename() in GitCorpusJob::run())

DeleteJob
	deletes job results on HDFS
	hides HDFS from users more

Result decorator for Hive queries
	allows users to promptly analyze data by Mahout
	needs VectorWritable parser for Hive

Better logging

Stopping Maven directory layout
	moves target/ and eclipse settings out of tree for Git-friendly
	uses CMake?

Spark movement
	potentially speeds up everything
	but needs to consider high memory pressures
	Parameter Server?

Job history and statistics collections
	e.g., Hadoop job configuration, task counters (.xml and .jhist files)
	may be useful for future uses

Add other data analytics
	machine learning, graph, etc.
